# 0.1.5 (08-06-15)

## Build Changes

There is a new build process for developing in Watchdog. You can now simply run `make run` in the root directory of Watchdog. This will run a bunch of grunt tasks that will do all the work required to build a Watchdog.app file in the dist/ directory. With this release, the new build process will only work for the OS X build. This will be updated in the future to automatically build the Windows and Linux apps as well.

Along with this new build process, the overall architecture of the Watchdog has changed. All of the major app code is now contained in the `watchdog\app` directory.
